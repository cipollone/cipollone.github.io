The videos of most lectures from the Reinforcement Learning Summer School 2023 are now available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_Kc5yfgADhuj0zLoufD-N0Qlgv5SoitW)!

This edition of the Reinforcement Learning Summer School has been in June 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.
Me and some members of the [AI-ML](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) research group contributed to the organization of this event.

Special thanks to [Matteo Papini](https://t3p.github.io/) and [Vincent Adam](https://vincentadam87.github.io/) for leading the organizing team.
