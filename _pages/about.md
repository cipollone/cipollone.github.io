I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in Engineering in Computer Science, at La Sapienza University of Rome.
I am working in the <a href='https://whitemech.github.io/'>WhiteMech</a> research group with Giuseppe De Giacomo.
In 2020, I graduated in Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and I've previously completed a Bachelor of Computer and System Engineering at the same university.

My PhD research mainly focuses on <em>Reinforcement Learning</em>. Specifically:
<ul>
    <li>
        learning in non-Markovian and history-dependent environments;
    </li>
    <li>
        hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and state-actions abstractions.
    </li>
</ul>
My background also covers other areas of Machine Learning and Formal Methods.

I have been TA for both Master's and Bachelor's courses. I have been reviewer for many AI conferences.
